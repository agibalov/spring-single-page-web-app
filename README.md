spring-single-page-web-app
==========================

A "home work" project aimed to get some experience in building single-page web applications. 
The general idea behind is to have service layer exposed as web-service available for web and mobile clients.

Things I'm using for backend:

1. HSQLDB for data persistence
2. Spring Data JPA for data access layer
3. Apache CXF to expose web-service
4. Spring for wiring all these backend things together
    
Things I'm using for frontend:

1. Spring MVC to provide external access to my "the only web page" and resources like scripts and templates
1. Twitter Bootstrap for making everything look fancier
2. Angular JS for not making this project become another piece of "I know JQuery" crap
